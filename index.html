            <p>Cooking is one of the oldest human practices — a daily necessity that has grown into an expression of culture, creativity, and care. At its simplest, cooking is about transforming raw ingredients into something nourishing. At its most complex, it becomes an art form, a science, and even a way to connect people across generations and geographies.</p>

            <p>For many, cooking is about preparing meals to fuel the body — boiling pasta, frying eggs, baking chicken, or throwing together a salad. These are everyday rituals that keep us going. It teaches patience, timing, and resourcefulness, especially when you&#39re working with limited ingredients or tools.</p>

            <p>Every culture in the world has a distinct culinary identity — from Indian curries to Italian pasta to Ethiopian injera. Recipes often pass down from parents to children, preserving traditions and stories. Cooking for others is also a universal gesture of love and hospitality. Sharing a meal can be one of the most intimate and joyful experiences.</p>
